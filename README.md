The Problem:
_If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

If we list all the natural numbers below 20 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18. The sum of these multiples is 78.

Write a JavaScript function that will find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 that are below a number N, where N is an input parameter to the function._
